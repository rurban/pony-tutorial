That's great, we're going to make that happen.\n\n\nThis tutorial is aimed at people who have some experience programming already. It doesn't really matter if you know a little Python, or a bit of Ruby, or you are a JavaScript hacker, or Java, or Scala, or C/C++, or Haskell, or OCaml: as long as you've written some code before, you should be fine.\n\n\nMore help\n\n\nIf you need more help than this tutorial gives you, you can always write to the developer's \nmailing list\n, or \nopen an issue\n. Whatever your question is, it isn't dumb, and we won't get annoyed.\n\n\nWhat's Pony, anyway?\n\n\nPony is an object-oriented, actor-model, capabilities-secure programming language. It's \nobject-oriented\n because it has classes and objects, like Python, Java, C++, and many other languages. It's \nactor-model\n because it has \nactors\n (similar to Erlang or Akka). These behave like objects, but they can also execute code \nasynchronously\n. Actors make Pony awesome. \n\n\nWhen we say Pony is \ncapabilities-secure\n, we mean a few things:\n\n\n\n\nIt's type safe. Really type safe. There's a mathematical proof and everything.\n\n\nIt's memory safe. Ok, this comes with type safe, but it's still interesting. There are no dangling pointers, no buffer overruns, heck, the language doesn't even have the concept of \nnull\n!\n\n\nIt's exception safe. There are no runtime exceptions. All exceptions have defined semantics, and they are \nalways\n handled.\n\n\nIt's data-race free. Pony doesn't have locks or atomic operations or anything like that. Instead, the type system ensures \nat compile time\n that your concurrent program can never have data races. So you can write highly concurrent code and never get it wrong.\n\n\nIt's deadlock free. This one is easy, because Pony has no locks at all! So they definitely don't deadlock, because they don't exist.",

The keyword \nactor\n means we are going to define an actor, which is a bit like a class in Python, Java, C#, C++, etc. Pony has classes too, which we'll see later.\n\n\nThe difference between an actor and a class is that an actor can have \nasynchronous\n methods, called \nbehaviours\n. We'll talk more about that later.\n\n\nA Pony program has to have a \nMain\n actor. It's kind of like the \nmain\n function in C or C++, or the \nmain\n method in Java, or the \nMain\n method in C#. It's where the action starts.\n\n\nLine 2\n\n\n  new create(env: Env) =\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a \nconstructor\n. The keyword \nnew\n means it's a function that creates a new instance of the type. In this case, it creates a new \nMain\n.\n\n\nUnlike other languages, constructors in Pony have names. That means there can be more than one way to construct an instance of a type. In this case, the name of the constructor is \ncreate\n.\n\n\nThe parameters of a function come next. In this case, our constructor has a single parameter called \nenv\n that is of the type \nEnv\n.\n\n\nIn Pony, the type of something always comes after its name, and is separated by a colon. In C, C++, Java or C#, you might say \nEnv env\n, but we do it the other way around (like Go, Pascal, and a bunch of other languages).\n\n\nIt turns out, our \nMain\n actor \nhas\n to have a constructor called \ncreate\n that takes a single parameter of type \nEnv\n. That's how all programs start! So the beginning of your program is essentially the body of that constructor.\n\n\nWait, what's the body?\n It's the code that comes after the \n=\n.\n\n\nLine 3\n\n\n    env.out.print(\nHello, world!\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis is your program! What the heck is it doing?\n\n\nIn Pony a dot is a either a field access or a method call, much like other languages. If the name after the dot has parentheses after it, it's a method call. Otherwise, it's a field access.\n\n\nSo here, we start with a reference to \nenv\n. We then lookup the field \nout\n on our object \nenv\n. As it happens, that field represents \nstdout\n, i.e. usually it means printing to your console. Then, we call the \nprint\n method on \nenv.out\n. The stuff inside the parentheses are the arguments to the function. In this case, we are passing a \nstring literal\n, i.e. the stuff in double quotes.\n\n\nIn Pony, string literals can be in double quotes, in which case they follow C/C++ style escaping (using stuff like \\n), or they can be in \"triple double\" quotes, like a Python triple quoted string, in which case they are considered raw data.\n\n\nWhat's an Env, anyway?\n It's the \"environment\" your program was invoked with. That means it has command line arguments, environment variables, \nstdin\n, \nstdout\n, and \nstderr\n. Pony has no global variables, so these things are explicitly passed to your program.\n\n\nThat's it!\n\n\nReally, that's it. The program begins by creating a \nMain\n actor, and in the constructor, we print \"Hello, world!\" to \nstdout\n.",

In Pony, the type of something always comes after its name, and is separated by a colon. In C, C++, Java or C#, you might say  Env env , but we do it the other way around (like Go, Pascal, and a bunch of other languages).  It turns out, our  Main  actor  has  to have a constructor called  create  that takes a single parameter of type  Env . That's how all programs start! So the beginning of your program is essentially the body of that constructor.  Wait, what's the body?  It's the code that comes after the  = .",

We then lookup the field  out  on our object  env . As it happens, that field represents  stdout , i.e. usually it means printing to your console. Then, we call the  print  method on  env.out .

And nothing else starts with a capital letter. So when you see a name in Pony code, you will instantly know whether it's a type or not.\n\n\nWhat goes in a class?\n\n\nA class is composed of:\n\n\n\n\nFields.\n\n\nConstructors.\n\n\nFunctions.\n\n\n\n\nFields\n\n\nThese are just like fields in C structs or fields in classes in C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, or basically any language, really. There are two kinds of fields: var fields and let fields. A var field can be assigned to over and over again, but a let field is assigned to in the constructor and never again.\n\n\nclass Wombat\n  let name: String\n  var _hunger_level: U64\n\n\n\n\nHere, a \nWombat\n has a \nname\n, which is a \nString\n, and a \n_hunger_level\n, which is a \nU64\n (an unsigned 64 bit integer).\n\n\nWhat does the leading underscore mean?\n It means something is \nprivate\n. A \nprivate\n field can only be accessed by code in the same type. A \nprivate\n constructor, function, or behaviour can only be accessed by code in the same package. We'll talk more about packages later.\n\n\nConstructors\n\n\nPony constructors have names. Other than that, they are just like constructors in other languages. They can have parameters, and they always return a new instance of the type. Since they have names, you can have more than one constructor for a type.\n\n\nConstructors are introduced with the \nnew\n keyword.\n\n\nclass Wombat\n  let name: String\n  var _hunger_level: U64\n\n  new create(name': String) =\n\n    name = name'\n    _hunger_level = 0\n\n  new hungry(name': String, hunger: U64) =\n\n    name = name'\n    _hunger_level = hunger\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have two constructors, one that creates a \nWombat\n that isn't hungry, and another that creates a \nWombat\n that might be hungry or might not.\n\n\nWhat's with the single quote thing, i.e. name'?\n You can use single quotes in parameter and local variable names. In mathematics, it's called a \nprime\n, and it's used to say \"another one of these, but not the same one\". Basically, it's just convenient.\n\n\nEverything has to get set in a constructor\n\n\nEvery constructor has to set every field in an object. If it doesn't, the compiler will give you an error. Since there is no \nnull\n in Pony, we can't do what Java, C# and many other languages do and just assign either \nnull\n or zero to every field before the constructor runs, and since we don't want random crashes, we don't leave fields undefined (unlike C or C++).\n\n\nField initialisers\n\n\nSometimes it's convenient to set a field the same way for all constructors.\n\n\nclass Wombat\n  let name: String\n  var _hunger_level: U64\n  var _thirst_level: U64 = 1\n\n  new create(name': String) =\n\n    name = name'\n    _hunger_level = 0\n\n  new hungry(name': String, hunger: U64) =\n\n    name = name'\n    _hunger_level = hunger\n\n\n\n\nHere, every \nWombat\n begins a little bit thirsty, regardless of which constructor is called.\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\nFunctions in Pony are like methods in Java, C#, C++, Ruby, Python, or pretty much any other object oriented language. They are introduced with the keyword \nfun\n. They can have parameters, like constructors do, and they can also have a result type (if no result type is given, it defaults to \nNone\n).\n\n\nclass Wombat\n  let name: String\n  var _hunger_level: U64\n  var _thirst_level: U64 = 1\n\n  new create(name': String) =\n\n    name = name'\n    _hunger_level = 0\n\n  new hungry(name': String, hunger: U64) =\n\n    name = name'\n    _hunger_level = hunger\n\n  fun hunger(): U64 =\n _hunger_level\n\n  fun ref set_hunger(to: U64 = 0): U64 =\n _hunger_level = to\n\n\n\n\nThe first function, \nhunger\n, is pretty straight forward. It has a result type of \nU64\n, and it returns \n_hunger_level\n, which is a \nU64\n. The only thing a bit different here is that no \nreturn\n keyword is used. This is because the result of a function is the result of the last expression in the function, in this case the value of \n_hunger_level\n.\n\n\nIs there a \nreturn\n keyword in Pony?\n Yes. It's used to return \"early\" from a function, i.e. to return something right away and not keep running until the last expression.\n\n\nThe second function, \nset_hunger\n, introduces a \nbunch\n of new concepts all at once. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n\nThe \nref\n keyword right after \nfun\n\n\nThis is a \ncapability\n. In this case, it means the \nreceiver\n, i.e. the object on which the \nset_hunger\n function is being called, has to be a \nref\n type. A \nref\n type is a \nreference type\n, meaning that the object is \nmutable\n. We need this because we are writing a new value to the \n_hunger_level\n field.\n\n\nWhat's the receiver capability of the \nhunger\n method?\n The default receiver capability if none is specified is \nbox\n, which means \"I need to be able to read from this, but I won't write to it\".\n\n\nWhat would happen if we left the \nref\n keyword off the \nset_hunger\n method?\n The compiler would give you an error. It would see you were trying to modify a field and complain about it.\n\n\nThe \n= 0\n after the parameter \nto\n\n\nThis is a \ndefault argument\n. It means that if you don't include that argument at the call site, you will get the default argument. In this case, \nto\n will be zero if you don't specify it.\n\n\nWhat does the function return?\n\n\nIt returns the \nold\n value of \n_hunger_level\n.\n\n\nWait, seriously? The \nold\n value?\n Yes. In Pony, assignment is an expression rather than a statement. That means it has a result. This is true of a lot of languages, but they tend to return the \nnew\n value. In other words, given \na = b\n, in most languages, the value of that is the value of \nb\n. But in Pony, the value of that is the \nold\n value of \na\n.\n\n\n...why?\n It's called a \"destructive read\", and it lets you do awesome things with a capabilities type system. We'll talk about that more later. For now, we'll just mention that you can also use it to implement a \nswap\n operation. In most languages, to swap the values of \na\n and \nb\n you need to do something like:\n\n\nvar temp = a\na = b\nb = temp\n\n\n\n\nIn Pony, you can just do:\n\n\na = b = a\n\n\n\n\nWhat about inheritance?\n\n\nIn some object-oriented languages, a type can \ninherit\n from another type, like how in Java something can \nextend\n something else. Pony doesn't do that. Instead, Pony prefers \ncomposition\n to \ninheritence\n. In other words, instead of getting code reuse by saying something \nis\n something else, you get it by saying something \nhas\n something else.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Pony has a powerful \ntrait\n system (similar to Java 8 interfaces that can have default implementations) and a powerful \ninterface\n system (similar to Go interfaces, i.e. structurally typed).\n\n\nWe'll talk about all that stuff in detail later.",

This is because the result of a function is the result of the last expression in the function, in this case the value of  _hunger_level .  Is there a  return  keyword in Pony?  Yes. It's used to return \"early\" from a function, i.e. to return something right away and not keep running until the last expression.  The second function,  set_hunger , introduces a  bunch  of new concepts all at once. Let's go through them one by one.  The  ref  keyword right after  fun  This is a  capability . In this case, it means the  receiver , i.e. the object on which the  set_hunger  function is being called, has to be a  ref  type. A  ref  type is a  reference type , meaning that the object is  mutable . We need this because we are writing a new value to the  _hunger_level  field.  What's the receiver capability of the  hunger  method?  The default receiver capability if none is specified is  box , which means \"I need to be able to read from this, but I won't write to it\".  What would happen if we left the  ref  keyword off the  set_hunger  method?  The compiler would give you an error. It would see you were trying to modify a field and complain about it.  The  = 0  after the parameter  to  This is a  default argument . It means that if you don't include that argument at the call site, you will get the default argument. In this case,  to  will be zero if you don't specify it.  What does the function return?  It returns the  old  value of  _hunger_level .  Wait, seriously? The  old  value?  Yes. In Pony, assignment is an expression rather than a statement. That means it has a result. This is true of a lot of languages, but they tend to return the  new  value. In other words, given  a = b , in most languages, the value of that is the value of  b . But in Pony, the value of that is the  old  value of  a .  ...why?  It's called a \"destructive read\", and it lets you do awesome things with a capabilities type system. We'll talk about that more later. For now, we'll just mention that you can also use it to implement a  swap  operation. In most languages, to swap the values of  a  and  b  you need to do something like:  var temp = a\na = b\nb = temp  In Pony, you can just do:  a = b = a",

            "text": "A \ntype alias\n is just a way to give a different name to a type. This may sound a bit silly: after all, types already have names! However, Pony can express some complicated types, and it can be convenient to have a short way to talk about them.\n\n\nWe'll give a couple examples of using type aliases, just to get the feel of them.\n\n\nEnumerations\n\n\nOne way to use type aliases is to express an enumeration. For example, imagine we want to say something must either be Red, Blue or Green. We could write something like this:\n\n\nprimitive Red\nprimitive Blue\nprimitive Green\n\ntype Colour is (Red | Blue | Green)\n\n\n\n\nThere are two new concepts in there. The first is the type alias, introduced with the keyword \ntype\n. It just means that the name that comes after \ntype\n will be translated by the compiler to the type that comes after \nis\n.\n\n\nThe second new concept is the type that comes after \nis\n. It's not a single type! Instead, it's a \nunion\n type. You can read the \n|\n symbol as \nor\n in this context, so the type is \"Red or Blue or Green\".\n\n\nA union type is a form of \nclosed world\n type. That is, it says every type that can possibly be a member of it. In contrast, object-oriented subtyping is usually \nopen world\n, e.g. in Java, an interface can be implemented by any number of classes.\n\n\nComplex types\n\n\nIf a type is complicated, it can be nice to give it a mnemonic name. For example, if we want to say that a type must implement more than one trait, we could say:\n\n\ninterface HasName\n  fun name(): String\n\ninterface HasAge\n  fun age(): U32\n\ninterface HasAddress\n  fun address(): String\n\ntype Person is (HasName \n HasAge \n HasAddress)\n\n\n\n\nThere's another new concept here: the type has a \n in it. This is similar to the \n|\n of a \nunion\n type: it means this is an \nintersection\n type. That is, it's something that must be \nall\n of \nHasName\n, \nHasAge\n \nand\n \nHasAddress\n.\n\n\nBut the use of \ntype\n here is exactly the same as the enumeration example above, it's just providing a name for a type that is otherwise a bit tedious to type out over and over.\n\n\nAnother example, this time from the standard library, is \nSetIs\n. Here's the actual definition:\n\n\ntype SetIs[A] is HashSet[A, HashIs[A!]]\n\n\n\n\nAgain there's something new here. After the name \nSetIs\n comes the name \nA\n in square brackets. That's because \nSetIs\n is a \ngeneric type\n. That is, you can give a \nSetIs\n another type as a parameter, to make specific kinds of set. If you've used Java or C#, this will be pretty familiar. If you've used C++, the equivalent concept is templates, but they work quite differently.\n\n\nAnd again the use of \ntype\n just provides a more convenient way to refer to the type we're aliasing:\n\n\nHashSet[A, HashIs[A!]]\n\n\n\n\nThat's another \ngeneric type\n. It means a \nSetIs\n is really a kind of \nHashSet\n. Another concept has snuck in, which is \n!\n types. This is a type that is the \nalias\n of another type. That's tricky stuff that you only need when writing complex generic types, so we'll leave it for later.\n\n\nOne more example, again from the standard library, is the \nMap\n type that gets used a lot. It's actually a type alias. Here's the real definition of \nMap\n:\n\n\ntype Map[K: (Hashable box \n Comparable[K] box), V] is HashMap[K, V, HashEq[K]]\n\n\n\n\nUnlike our previous example the first type parameter, \nK\n, has a type associated with it.

We could write something like this:  primitive Red\nprimitive Blue\nprimitive Green\n\ntype Colour is (Red | Blue | Green)  There are two new concepts in there. The first is the type alias, introduced with the keyword  type . It just means that the name that comes after  type  will be translated by the compiler to the type that comes after  is .  The second new concept is the type that comes after  is . It's not a single type! Instead, it's a  union  type. You can read the  |  symbol as  or  in this context, so the type is \"Red or Blue or Green\".  A union type is a form of  closed world  type. That is, it says every type that can possibly be a member of it.

For example, if we want to say that a type must implement more than one trait, we could say:  interface HasName\n  fun name(): String\n\ninterface HasAge\n  fun age(): U32\n\ninterface HasAddress\n  fun address(): String\n\ntype Person is (HasName   HasAge   HasAddress)  There's another new concept here: the type has a   in it. This is similar to the  |  of a  union  type: it means this is an  intersection  type. That is, it's something that must be  all  of  HasName ,  HasAge   and   HasAddress .  But the use of  type  here is exactly the same as the enumeration example above, it's just providing a name for a type that is otherwise a bit tedious to type out over and over.  Another example, this time from the standard library, is  SetIs . Here's the actual definition:  type SetIs[A] is HashSet[A, HashIs[A!]]  Again there's something new here. After the name  SetIs  comes the name  A  in square brackets. That's because  SetIs  is a  generic type . That is, you can give a  SetIs  another type as a parameter, to make specific kinds of set. If you've used Java or C#, this will be pretty familiar. If you've used C++, the equivalent concept is templates, but they work quite differently.  And again the use of  type  just provides a more convenient way to refer to the type we're aliasing:  HashSet[A, HashIs[A!]]  That's another  generic type . It means a  SetIs  is really a kind of  HashSet . Another concept has snuck in, which is  !  types. This is a type that is the  alias  of another type. That's tricky stuff that you only need when writing complex generic types, so we'll leave it for later.  One more example, again from the standard library, is the  Map  type that gets used a lot. It's actually a type alias. Here's the real definition of  Map :  type Map[K: (Hashable box   Comparable[K] box), V] is HashMap[K, V, HashEq[K]]  Unlike our previous example the first type parameter,  K , has a type associated with it. This is a  constraint , which means when you parameterise a  Map , the type you pass for  K  must be a subtype of the constraint.  Also notice that  box  appears in the type. This is a  capability . It means there is a certain class of operations we need to be able to do on a  K . We'll cover this in more detail later.

If you're used to object-oriented programming, you may not have seen these before, but they are common in functional programming. A \ntype expression\n is also called an \nalgebraic data type\n.\n\n\nThere are three kinds of type expression: \ntuples\n, \nunions\n, and \nintersections\n.\n\n\nTuples\n\n\nA \ntuple\n is a sequence of types. For example, if we wanted something that was a \nString\n followed by a \nU64\n, we would write this:\n\n\nvar x: (String, U64)\nx = (\nhi\n, 3)\nx = (\nbye\n, 7)\n\n\n\n\nAll type expressions are written in parentheses, and the elements of a tuple are separated by a comma. We can also destructure a tuple using assignment:\n\n\n(var y, var z) = x\n\n\n\n\nOr we can access the elements of a tuple directly:\n\n\nvar y = x._1\nvar z = x._2\n\n\n\n\nNote that there's no way to assign to an element of a tuple. Instead, you can just reassign the entire tuple, like this:\n\n\nx = (\nwombat\n, x._2)\n\n\n\n\nWhy use a tuple instead of a class?\n Tuples are a way to express a collection of values that doesn't have any associated code or expected behaviour. Basically, if you just need a quick collection of things, maybe to return more than one value from a function for example, you can use a tuple.\n\n\nUnions\n\n\nA \nunion\n type is written like a \ntuple\n, but it uses a \n|\n (pronounced \"or\" when reading the type) instead of a \n,\n between its elements. Where a tuple represents a collection of values, a union represents a \nsingle\n value that can be any of the specified types.\n\n\nUnions can be used for tons of stuff that require multiple concepts in other languages. For example, optional values, enumerations, marker values, and more.\n\n\nvar x: (String | None)\n\n\n\n\nHere we have an example of using a union to express an optional type, where \nx\n might be a \nString\n, but it also might be \nNone\n.\n\n\nIntersections\n\n\nAn \nintersection\n uses a \n (pronounced \"and\" when reading the type) between its elements. It represents the exact opposite of a union: it is a \nsingle\n value that is \nall\n of the specified types, at the same time!\n\n\nThis can be very useful for combining traits or interfaces, for example.

By using something called capabilities. These allow you to specify which of your objects can be shared with other actors and allow the compiler to check that what you're doing is concurrency safe.\n\n\nI think I've heard of capabilities, what other languages have them?\n \nCapabilities security\n has been around for a long time, and there are several capabilities-secure languages. Our favourite is \nE\n. Pony is capabilities-secure, and it also introduces a new form of capability \ntype qualifier\n that gives programmers some interesting new... capabilities.\n\n\nBasic concepts\n\n\nThere are a few simple concepts you need to understand before capabilities will make any sense. We've talked about some of these already, and some may already be obvious to you, but it's worth recapping here.\n\n\nShared mutable data is hard\n\n\nThe problem with concurrency is shared mutable data. If two different threads have access to the same piece of data then they might try to update it at the same time. At best this can lead to the two threads having different versions of the data. At worst the updates can interact badly resulting in the data being overwritten with garbage. The standard way to avoid these problems is to use locks to prevent data updates from happening at the same time. This causes big performance hits and is very difficult to get right, so it causes lots of bugs.\n\n\nImmutable data can be safely shared\n\n\nAny data that is immutable (i.e. it cannot can changed) is safe to use concurrently. Since it is immutable it is never updated and it's the updates that cause concurrency problems.\n\n\nIsolated data is safe\n\n\nIf a block of data has only one reference to it then we call it \nisolated\n. Since there is only one reference to it, isolated data cannot be \nshared\n by multiple threads, so there are no concurrency problems. Isolated data can be passed between multiple threads. As long as only one of them has a reference to it at a time then the data is still safe from concurrency problems.\n\n\nIsolated data may be complex\n\n\nAn isolated piece of data may be a single byte. But it can also be a large data structure with multiple references between the various objects in that structure. What matters for the data to be isolated is that there is only a single reference to that structure as a whole. We talk about the \nisolation boundary\n of a data structure. For the structure to be isolated:\n\n\n\n\nThere must only be a single reference outside the boundary that points to an object inside.\n\n\nThere can be any number of references inside the boundary, but none of them must point to an object outside.\n\n\n\n\nEvery actor is single threaded\n\n\nThe code within a single actor is never run concurrently. This means that, within a single actor, data updates cannot cause problems. It's only when we want to share data between actors that we have problems.\n\n\nOK, safely sharing data concurrently is tricky. How do capabilities help?\n\n\nBy sharing only immutable data and exchanging only isolated data we can have safe concurrent programs without locks. The problem is that it's very difficult to do that correctly. If you accidentally hang on to a reference to some isolated data you've handed over or change something you've shared as immutable then everything goes wrong. What you need is for the compiler to force you to live up to your promises. Pony capabilities allow the compiler to do just that.\n\n\nType qualifiers\n\n\nIf you've used C/C++, you may be familiar with \nconst\n, which is a \ntype qualifier\n that tells the compiler not to allow the programmer to \nmutate\n something.\n\n\nA capability is a form of \ntype qualifier\n and provides a lot more guarantees than \nconst\n does!\n\n\nIn Pony, every use of a type has a capability. These capabilities apply to variables, rather than to the type as a whole. In other words, when you define a \nclass Wombat\n, you don't pick a capability for it. Instead, \nWombat\n variables each have their own capability.\n\n\nAs an example, in some languages you have to define a type that represents a mutable \nString\n and another type that represents an immutable \nString\n. For example, in Java there is a \nString\n and a \nStringBuilder\n. In Pony, you can define a single \nclass String\n and have some variables that are \nString ref\n (which are mutable) and other variables that are \nString val\n (which are immutable).\n\n\nThe list of capabilities\n\n\nThere are six capabilities in Pony and they all have strict definitions and rules on how they can be used. We'll get to all of that later, but for now here are their names and what you use them for:\n\n\nIsolated\n, written \niso\n. This is for references to isolated data structures. If you have an \niso\n variable then you know that there are no other variables that can access that data. So you can change it however you like and give it to another actor.\n\n\nValue\n, written \nval\n. This is for references to immutable data structures. If you have a \nval\n variable then you know that no-one can change the data. So you can read it and share it with other actors.\n\n\nReference\n, written \nref\n. This is for references to mutable data structures that are not isolated, in other words \"normal\" data. If you have a \nref\n variable then you can read and write the data however you like and you can have multiple variables that can access the same data. But you can't share it with other actors.\n\n\nBox\n. This is for references to data that is read-only to you. That data might be immutable and shared with other actors or there may be other variables using it in your actor that can change the data. Either way the \nbox\n variable can be used to safely read the data. This may sound a little pointless, but it allows you to write code that can work for both \nval\n and \nref\n variables, as long as it doesn't write to the object.\n\n\nTransition\n, written \ntrn\n. This is used for data structures that you want to write to and give out read-only (\nbox\n) variables to. You can also convert the \ntrn\n variable to a \nval\n variable later if you wish, which stops anyone from changing the data and allows it be shared with other actors.\n\n\nTag\n. This is for references used only for identification. You cannot read or write data using a \ntag\n variable. But you can store and compare \ntag\ns to check object identity and share \ntag\n variables with other actors.\n\n\nNote that if you have a variable referring to an actor then you can send messages to that actor regardless of what capability that variable is.\n\n\nHow to write a capability\n\n\nA capability comes at the end of a type. So, for example:\n\n\nString iso // An isolated string\nString trn // A transition string\nString ref // A string reference\nString val // A string value\nString box // A string box\nString tag // A string tag\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean when a type doesn't specify a capability?\n It means you are using the \ndefault\n capability for that type, which is defined along with the type. Here's an example from the standard library:\n\n\nclass String val\n\n\n\n\nWhen we use a \nString\n we usually mean a string value, so we make \nval\n the default capability for \nString\n.\n\n\nSo do I have to specify a capability when I define a type?\n Only if you want to. There are sensible defaults that most types will use. These are \nref\n for classes, \nval\n for primitives and \ntag\n for actors.",

This means a \ntrn\n variable is the only variable anywhere in the program that can write to that object, but other variables held by the the same actor may be able to read from it. It is \nwrite unique\n.\n\n\nIf an actor has a \nref\n variable, no other variable can be used by \nother\n actors to read from or write to that object. This means that other variables can be used to read from and write to the object, but only from within the same actor.\n\n\n\n\nWhy can they be used to write?\n Because they all stop \nother\n actors from reading from or writing to the object. Since we know no other actor will be reading, it's safe for us to write to the object, without having to worry about data-races. And since we know no other actor will be writing, it's safe for us to read from the object, too.\n\n\nImmutable capabilities\n\n\nThe \nimmutable\n capabilities are \nval\n and \nbox\n. These capabilities are \nimmutable\n because they can be used to read from an object, but not to write to it.\n\n\n\n\nIf an actor has a \nval\n variable, no other variable can be used by \nany\n actor to write to that object. This means that the object can't \never\n change. It is \nglobally immutable\n.\n\n\nIf an actor has a \nbox\n variable, no other variable can be used by \nother\n actors to write to that object. This means that other actors may be able to read the object and other variables in the same actor may be able to write to it (although not both). In either case it is safe for us to read. The object is \nlocally immutable\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhy can they be used to read but not write?\n Because these capabilities only stop \nother\n actors from writing to the object. That means there is no guarantee that \nother\n actors aren't reading from the object, which means it's not safe for us to write to it. It's safe for more than one actor to read from an object at the same time though, so we're allowed to do that.\n\n\nOpaque capabilities\n\n\nThere's only one \nopaque\n capability, which is \ntag\n. A \ntag\n variable makes no guarantees about other variables at all. As a result, it can't be used to either read from or write to the object.\n\n\nIt's still useful though: you can do identity comparison with it, you can call behaviours on it, and you can call functions on it that only need a \ntag\n receiver.\n\n\nWhy can't \ntag\n be used to read or write?\n Because \ntag\n doesn't stop \nother\n actors from writing to the object.

You just assign some variable to another variable, and there you go, you have an alias. The variable you assign to has the same type (or some supertype) as what's being assigned to it, and everything is fine.\n\n\nIn Pony, that works for some capabilities, but not all.\n\n\nAliasing and deny guarantees\n\n\nThe reason for this is that \niso\n capabilities deny other \niso\n variables that point to the same object. That is, you can only have one \niso\n variable pointing to any given object. The same goes for \ntrn\n.\n\n\nfun test(a: Wombat iso) =\n\n  var b: Wombat iso = a // Not allowed!\n\n\n\n\nHere we have some function that gets passed an isolated Wombat. If we try to alias \na\n by assigning it to \nb\n, we'll be breaking capability guarantees so the compiler will stop us.\n\n\nWhat can I alias an \niso\n as?\n Since an \niso\n says no other variable can be used by \nany\n actor to read from or write to that object, we can only create aliases to an \niso\n that can neither read nor write. Fortunately, we've got a capability that does exactly that: \ntag\n. So we can do this and the compiler will be happy:\n\n\nfun test(a: Wombat iso) =\n\n  var b: Wombat tag = a // Allowed!\n\n\n\n\nWhat about aliasing \ntrn\n?\n Since a \ntrn\n says no other variable can be used by \nany\n actor to write to that object, we need something that doesn't allow writing, but also doesn't prevent our \ntrn\n variable from writing. Fortunately, weve got a capability that does that too: \nbox\n. So we can do this and the compiler will be happy:\n\n\nfun test(a: Wombat trn) =\n\n  var b: Wombat box = a // Allowed!\n\n\n\n\nWhat about aliasing other stuff?\n Everything else can be aliased as itself. So \nref\n can be aliased as \nref\n, \nval\n can be aliased as \nval\n, \nbox\n can be aliased as \nbox\n and \ntag\n can be aliased as \ntag\n.\n\n\nWhat counts as making an alias?\n\n\nThere are two things that count as making an alias:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you \nassign\n a value to a variable. This could be a local variable or a field.\n\n\nWhen you \npass\n a value as an argument to a method.\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, you are making a new \nname\n for the object. This might be the name of a local variable, the name of a field, or the name of a parameter to a method.\n\n\nConsuming a variable\n\n\nSometimes, you want to \nmove\n an object from one variable to another. In other words, you don't want to make a \nnew\n name for the object, exactly, you want to move the object from some existing name to a different one.\n\n\nYou can do this by using consume. When you consume a variable you take the value out of it, effectively leaving the variable empty. No code can read from that variable again until a new value is written to it. Consuming a local variable or a parameter allows you to make an alias with the same type, even if it's an \niso\n or \ntrn\n. For example:\n\n\nfun test(a: Wombat iso) =\n\n  var b: Wombat iso = consume a // Allowed!\n\n\n\n\nThe compiler is happy with that, because by consuming \na\n, you've said the value can't be used again and the compiler will complain if you try to.\n\n\nfun test(a: Wombat iso) =\n\n  var b: Wombat iso = consume a // Allowed!\n  var c: Wombat tag = a // Not allowed!\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example of that. When you try to assign \na\n to \nc\n, the compiler will complain.\n\n\nCan I \nconsume\n a field?\n Definitely not! Consuming something means it is empty, that is, it has no value. There's no way to be sure no other alias to the object will access that field. If we tried to access a field that was empty, we would crash. But there's a way to do what you want to do: \ndestructive read\n.\n\n\nDestructive read\n\n\nThere's another way to \nmove\n a value from one name to another. Earlier, we talked about how assignment in Pony returns the \nold\n value of the left-hand side, rather than the new value. This is called \ndestructive read\n, and we can use it to do what we want to do, even with fields.\n\n\nclass Aardvark\n  var buddy: Wombat iso\n\n  fun test(a: Wombat iso) =\n\n    var b: Wombat iso = buddy = consume a // Allowed!\n\n\n\n\nHere, we consume \na\n, assign it to the field \nbuddy\n, and assign the \nold\n value of \nbuddy\n to \nb\n.\n\n\nWhy is it ok to destructively read fields when we can't consume them?\n Because when we do a destructive read, we assign to the field so it always has a value. Unlike \nconsume\n, there's no time when the field is empty. That means it's safe and the compiler doesn't complain.\n\n\nEphemeral types\n\n\nIn Pony, every expression has a type. So what's the type of \nconsume a\n? It's not the same type as \na\n, because it might not be possible to alias \na\n. Instead, it's an \nephemeral\n type. That is, it's a type for a value that currently has no name (it might have a name through some other alias, but not the one we just consumed or destructively read).\n\n\nTo show a type is ephemeral, we put a \n^\n at the end. For example:\n\n\nfun test(a: Wombat iso): Wombat iso^ =\n\n  consume a\n\n\n\n\nHere, our function takes an isolated Wombat as a parameter, and returns an ephemeral isolated Wombat.\n\n\nThis is useful for dealing with \niso\n and \ntrn\n types, and for generic types, but it's also important for constructors. A constructor always returns an ephemeral type, because it's a new object.\n\n\nAlias types\n\n\nFor the same reason Pony has ephemeral types, it also has alias types. An alias type is a way of saying \"whatever we can safely alias this thing as\". It's only needed when dealing with generic types, which we'll discuss later.\n\n\nWe indicate an alias type by putting a \n!\n at the end. Here's an example:\n\n\nfun test(a: A) =\n\n  var b: A! = a\n\n\n\n\nHere, we're using \nA\n as a \ntype variable\n, which we'll cover later.

But probably not yet. To help it seem natural, let's walk through each cell in the table and explain why it is the way it is.\n\n\nReading from an \niso\n variable\n\n\nAnything read through an \niso\n origin has to maintain the isolation guarantee that the origin has. The key thing to remember is that the \niso\n can be sent to another actor and it can also become any other capability. So when we read a field, we need to get a result that won't ever break the isolation guarantees that the origin makes, that is, \nread and write uniqueness\n.\n\n\nAn \niso\n field makes the same guarantees as an \niso\n origin, so that's fine to read. A \nval\n field is \nglobally immutable\n, which means it's always ok to read it, no matter what the origin is (well, other than \ntag\n).\n\n\nEverything else, though, can break our isolation guarantees. That's why other capabilities are seen as \ntag\n: it's the only type that is neither readable nor writeable.\n\n\nReading from a \ntrn\n variable\n\n\nThis is like \niso\n, but with a weaker guarantee (\nwrite uniqueness\n as opposed to \nread and write uniqueness\n). That makes a big difference, since now we can return something readable when we enforce our guarantees.\n\n\nAn \niso\n field makes stronger guarantees than a \ntrn\n origin, and a \ntrn\n field makes the same guarantees, so they're fine to read. A \nval\n field is \nglobally immutable\n, so that's fine too. A \nbox\n field is readable, and we only guarantee \nwrite uniqueness\n, so that's fine too.\n\n\nA \nref\n field, though, would allow writing. So instead we return a \nbox\n capability.\n\n\nReading from a \nref\n variable\n\n\nA \nref\n origin doesn't modify its fields at all. This is because a \nref\n origin doesn't make any guarantees that are incompatible with its fields.\n\n\nReading from a \nval\n variable\n\n\nA \nval\n origin is deeply and globally immutable, so all of its fields are also \nval\n. The only exception is a \ntag\n field. Since we can't read from it, we also can't guarantee that nobody can write to it, so it stays \ntag\n.\n\n\nReading from a \nbox\n variable\n\n\nA \nbox\n variable is locally immutable. This means it's possible that it may be mutated through some other variable (a \ntrn\n or a \nref\n), but it's also possible that our \nbox\n variable is an alias of some \nval\n variable.\n\n\nWhen we read a field, we need to return a capability that is compatible with the field, but is also locally immutable.\n\n\nAn \niso\n field is returned as a \ntag\n because no locally immutable capability can maintain its isolation guarantees. A \nval\n field is returned as a \nval\n because global immutability is a stronger guarantee than local immutability. A \nbox\n field makes the same local immutability guarantee as its origin, so that's also fine.\n\n\nFor \ntrn\n and \nref\n we need to return a locally immutable capability that doesn't violate any guarantees the field makes. In both cases, we can return \nbox\n.\n\n\nReading from a \ntag\n variable\n\n\nThis one is easy: \ntag\n variables are opaque! They can't be read from.",

There are a few different kinds of variables which have different lifetimes and are used for slightly different purposes.\n\n\nLocal variables\n\n\nLocal variables in Pony work very much as they do in other languages, allowing you to store temporary values while you perform calculations. Local variables live within a chunk of code (they are \nlocal\n to that chunk) and are created every time that code chunk executes and disposed of when it completes.\n\n\nTo define a local variable the \nvar\n keyword is used (\nlet\n can also be used, but we'll get to that later). Right after the \nvar\n comes the variable's name, and then you can (optionally) put a \n:\n followed by the variable's type. For example:\n\n\nvar x: String = \nHello\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we're assigning the \nstring literal\n \n\"Hello\"\n to \nx\n.\n\n\nYou don't have to give a value to the variable when you define it: you can assign one later if you prefer. If you try to read the value from a variable before you've assigned one, the compiler will complain instead of allowing the dreaded \nuninitialised variable\n bug.\n\n\nEvery variable has a type, but you don't have to specify it in the declaration if you provide an initial value. The compiler will automatically use the type of the initial value for the variable.\n\n\nThe following definitions of \nx\n, \ny\n and \nz\n are all effectively identical.\n\n\nvar x: String = \nHello\n\n\nvar y = \nHello\n\n\nvar z: String\nz = \nHello\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I miss out both the type and initial value for a variable?\n No. The compiler will complain that it can't figure out a type for that variable.\n\n\nAll local variable names start with a lower case letter. If you want to you can end them with a \nprime\n \n'\n (or more than one) which is useful when you need a second variable with almost the same meaning as the first. For example you might have one variable called \ntime\n and another called \ntime'\n.\n\n\nThe chunk of code that a variable lives in is known as its \nscope\n. Exactly what its scope is depends on where it is defined. For example, the scope of a variable defined within the \nthen\n expression of an \nif\n statement is that \nthen\n expression. We haven't looked at \nif\n statements yet, but they're very similar to every other language.\n\n\nif a \n b then\n  var x = \na is bigger\n\n  env.out.print(x)  // OK\nend\n\nenv.out.print(x)  // Illegal\n\n\n\n\nVariables only exists from when they are defined until the end of the current scope. For our variable \nx\n this is the \nend\n at the end of the then expression: after that it cannot be used.\n\n\nVar vs. let\n\n\nLocal variables are declared with either a \nvar\n or a \nlet\n. Using \nvar\n means the variable can be assigned and reassigned as many times as you like. Using \nlet\n means the variable can only be assigned once.\n\n\nvar x: U32 = 3\nlet y: U32 = 4\nx = 5  // OK\ny = 6  // Error, y is let\n\n\n\n\nYou never have to declare variables as \nlet\n, but if you know you're never going to change a variable then using \nlet\n is a good way to catch errors. It can also serve as a useful comment, indicating the value is not meant to be changed.\n\n\nFields\n\n\nIn Pony, fields are variables that live within objects. They work like fields in other object-oriented langauges.\n\n\nFields have the same lifetime as the object they're in, rather than being scoped. They are set up by the object constructor and disposed of along with the object.\n\n\nIf the name of a field starts with \n_\n, it's \nprivate\n. That means only the type the field is in can have code that reads or writes that field. Otherwise, the field is \npublic\n, and can be read or written anywhere.\n\n\nJust like local variables, fields can be \nvar\n or \nlet\n. They can also have initial value assigned in their definition, just like local variables, or they can be given their initial value in a constructor.\n\n\nGlobals\n\n\nSome programming languages have \nglobal variables\n that can be accessed from anywhere in the code. What a bad idea! Pony doesn't have global variables at all.\n\n\nShadowing\n\n\nSome programming languages let you declare a variable with the same name as an existing variable, and then there are rules about which one you get. This is called \nshadowing\n, and it's a source of bugs. If you accidentally shadow a variable in Pony, the compiler will complain.\n\n\nIf you need a variable with \nnearly\n the same name, you can use a prime \n'\n.",

            "text": "To do real work in a program you have to be able to make decisions, iterate through collections of items and perform actions repeatedly. For this you need control structures. Pony has control structures that will be familiar to programmers who have used most languages, such as \nif\n, \nwhile\n and \nfor\n, but in Pony they work slightly differently.\n\n\nConditionals\n\n\nThe simplest control-structure is the good old \nif\n. It allows you to perform some action only when a condition is true. In Pony it looks like this:\n\n\nif a \n b then\n  env.out.print(\na is bigger\n)\nend\n\n\n\n\nCan I use integers and pointers for the condition like I can in C?\n No. In Pony \nif\n conditions must have type Bool, i.e. they are always true or false. If you want to test whether a number \na\n is not 0, then you need to explicitly say \na != 0\n. This restriction removes a whole category of potential bugs from Pony programs.\n\n\nIf you want some alternative code for when the condition fails just add an \nelse\n:\n\n\nif a \n b then\n  env.out.print(\na is bigger\n)\nelse\n  env.out.print(\na is not bigger\n)\nend\n\n\n\n\nOften you want to test more than condition in one go, giving you more than two possible outcomes. You can nest \nif\n statements, but this quickly gets ugly:\n\n\nif a == b then\n  env.out.print(\nthey are the same\n)\nelse\n  if a \n b then\n    env.out.print(\na is bigger\n)\n  else\n    env.out.print(\nb bigger\n)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n\nAs an alternative Pony provides the \nelseif\n keyword that combines an \nelse\n and an \nif\n. This works the same as saying \nelse if\n in other languages and you can have as many \nelseif\ns as you like for each \nif\n.\n\n\nif a == b then\n  env.out.print(\nthey are the same\n)\nelseif a \n b then\n  env.out.print(\na is bigger\n)\nelse\n  env.out.print(\nb bigger\n)\nend\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I just say \"else if\" like I do in C? Why the extra keyword?\n The relationship between \nif\n and \nelse\n in C, and other similar languages, is ambiguous. For example:\n\n\n// C code\nif(a)\n  if(b)\n    printf(\na and b\\n\n);\nelse\n  printf(\nnot a\\n\n);\n\n\n\n\nHere it is not obvious whether the \nelse\n is an alternative to the first or the second \nif\n. In fact here the \nelse\n relates to the \nif(b)\n so our example contains a bug. Pony avoids this type of bug by handling \nif\n and \nelse\n differently and the need for \nelseif\n comes out of that.\n\n\nEverything is an expression\n\n\nThe big difference for control structures between Pony and other languages is that in Pony everything is an expression. In languages like C++ and Java \nif\n is a statement, not an expression. This means that you can't have an \nif\n inside an expression, there has to be a separate conditional operator '?'.\n\n\nIn Pony there are no statements there are only expressions, everything hands back a value. Your \nif\n statement hands you back a value. Your \nfor\n loop (which we'll get to a bit later) hands you back a value. \n\n\nThis means you can use \nif\n directly in a calculation:\n\n\nx = 1 + if lots then 100 else 2 end\n\n\n\n\nThis will give \nx\n a value of either 3 or 101, depending on the variable \nlots\n.\n\n\nIf the \nthen\n and \nelse\n branches of an \nif\n produce different types then the \nif\n produces a \nunion\n of the two.\n\n\nvar x: (String | Bool) =\n  if friendly then\n    \nHello\n\n  else\n    false\n  end\n\n\n\n\nBut what if my if doesn't have an else?\n Any \nelse\n branch that doesn't exist gives an implicit \nNone\n.\n\n\nvar x: (String | None) =\n  if friendly then\n    \nHello\n\n  end\n\n\n\n\nDoes Pony still have the conditional operator \"?\"?\n No, it's not needed. Just use \nif\n.\n\n\nLoops\n\n\nif\n allows you to choose what to do, but to do something more than once you want a loop.\n\n\nWhile\n\n\nPony \nwhile\n loops are very similar to those in other languages. A condition expression is evaluated and if it's true we execute the code inside the loop. When we're done we evaluate the condition again and keep going until it's false.\n\n\nHere's an example that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\n\n\nvar count: U32 = 1\n\nwhile count \n= 10 do\n  env.out.print(count)\n  count = count + 1\nend\n\n\n\n\nJust like \nif\n expressions \nwhile\n is also an expression. The value returned is just the value of the expression inside the loop the last time we go round it. For this example that will be the value given by \ncount = count + 1\n when count is incremented to 11. Since Pony assignments hand back the \nold\n value our \nwhile\n loop will return 10.\n\n\nBut what if the condition evaluates to false the first time we try, then we don't go round the loop at all?\n In Pony \nwhile\n expressions can also have an \nelse\n block. In general, Pony \nelse\n blocks provide a value when the expression they are attached to doesn't. A \nwhile\n doesn't have a value to give if the condition evaluates to false the first time, so the \nelse\n provides it instead.\n\n\nSo is this like an else block on a while loop in Python?\n No, this is very different. In Python the \nelse\n is run when the \nwhile\n completes. In Pony the \nelse\n is only run when the expression in the \nwhile\n isn't.\n\n\nBreak\n\n\nSometimes you want to stop part-way through a loop and give up altogether. Pony has the \nbreak\n keyword for this and it is very similar to its counterpart in langauges like C++, C# and Python.\n\n\nbreak\n immediately exits from the innermost loop it's in. Since the loop has to return a value \nbreak\n can take an expression. This is optional and if it's missed out a value of \nNone\n is returned.\n\n\nLet's have an example. Suppose you want to go through a list of names you're getting from somewhere, looking for either \"Jack\" or \"Jill\". If neither of those appear you'll just take the last name you're given and if you're not given any names at all you'll use \"Herbert\".\n\n\nvar name =\n  while moreNames() do\n    var name' = getName()\n    if name' == \nJack\n or name' == \nJill\n then\n      break name'\n    end\n    name'\n  else\n    \nHerbert\n\n  end\n\n\n\n\nSo first we ask if there are any more names to get. If there are then we get a name and see if it's \"Jack\" or \"Jill\". If it is we're done and we break out of the loop, handing back the name we've found. If not we try again.\n\n\nThe line \nname'\n appears at the end of the loop so that will be our value returned from the last iteration, if neither \"Jack\" nor \"Jill\" is found.\n\n\nThe \nelse\n block provides our value of \"Herbert\" if there are no names available at all.\n\n\nCan I break out of multiple, nested loops like the Java labelled break?\n No, Pony does not support that. If you need to break out of multiple loops you should probably refactor your code or use a worker function.\n\n\nContinue\n\n\nSometimes you want to stop part-way through one loop iteration and move onto the next. Like other languages Pony uses the \ncontinue\n keywords for this.\n\n\ncontinue\n stops executing the current iteration of the innermost loop it's in and evaluates the condition ready for the next iteration.\n\n\nIf \ncontinue\n is executed during the last iteration of the loop then we have no value to return from the loop. In this case we use the loop's \nelse\n expression to get a value. As with the \nif\n expression if no \nelse\n expression is provided \nNone\n is returned.\n\n\nCan I continue an outer, nested loop like the Java labelled continue?\n No, Pony does not support that. If you need to continue an outer loop you should probably refactor your code.\n\n\nFor\n\n\nFor iterating over a collection of items Pony uses the \nfor\n keyword. This is very similar to \nforeach\n in C#, \nfor\n..\nin\n in Python and \nfor\n in Java when used with a collection. It is very different to \nfor\n in C and C++.\n\n\nThe Pony \nfor\n loop iterates over a collection of items using an iterator. On each iteration round the loop we ask the iterator if there are any more elements to process and if there are we ask it for the next one.\n\n\nFor example to print out all the strings in an array:\n\n\nfor name in [\nBob\n, \nFred\n, \nSarah\n].values() do\n  env.out.print(name)\nend\n\n\n\n\nNote the call to \nvalues()\n on the array, this is because the loop needs an iterator not an array.\n\n\nThe iterator does not have to be of any particular type, but needs to provide the following methods:\n\n\n  fun has_next(): Bool\n  fun next(): T?\n\n\n\n\nwhere T is the type of the objects in the collection. You don't need to worry about this unless you're writing your own iterators. To use existing collections, such as those provided in the standard library, you can just use \nfor\n and it will all work. If you do write your own iterators note that we use structural typing, so your iterator doesn't need to declare that it provides any particular type.\n\n\nYou can think of the above example as being equivalent to:\n\n\nlet iterator = [\nBob\n, \nFred\n, \nSarah\n].values()\nwhile iterator.has_next() do\n  let name = iterator.next()\n  env.out.print(name)\nend\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variable \nname\n is declared \nlet\n, you cannot assign to the control variable within the loop.\n\n\nCan I use break and continue with for loops?\n Yes, \nfor\n loops can have \nelse\n expressions attached and can use \nbreak\n and \ncontinue\n just as for \nwhile\n.\n\n\nRepeat\n\n\nThe final loop construct that Pony provides is \nrepeat\n \nuntil\n. Here we evaluate the expression in the loop and then evaluate a condition expression to see if we're done or we should go round again.\n\n\nThis is similar to \ndo\n \nwhile\n in C++, C# and Java except that the termination condition is reversed, i.e. those languages terminate the loop when the condition expression is false, Pony terminates the loop when the condition expression is true.\n\n\nThe differences between \nwhile\n and \nrepeat\n in Pony are:\n\n\n\n\nWe always go round the loop at least once with \nrepeat\n, whereas with \nwhile\n we may not go round at all.\n\n\nThe termination condition is reversed.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we're trying to create something and we want to keep trying until it's good enough:\n\n\nrepeat\n  var present = makePresent()\nuntil present.marksOutOfTen() \n 7 end\n\n\n\n\nJust like \nwhile\n loops the value given by a \nrepeat\n loop is the value of the expression within the loop on the last iteration and \nbreak\n and \ncontinue\n can be used.\n\n\nSince you always go round a repeat loop at least once do you ever need to give it an else expression?\n Yes you may need to. A \ncontinue\n in the last iteration of a \nrepeat\n loop needs to get a value from somewhere and an \nelse\n expression is used for that.",

There are three kinds of methods; functions, constructors and behaviours. All methods are attached to type definitions (e.g. classes), there are no global functions.\n\n\nBehaviours are used for handling asynchronous messages sent to actors. We'll look at those later.\n\n\nCan I have some code outside of any methods, like I do in Python?\n No. All Pony code must be within a method.\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\nPony functions are quite like functions (or methods) in other languages. They can have 0 or more parameters and 0 or 1 return values.\n\n\nclass C\n  fun add(x: U32, y: U32): U32 =\n\n    x + y\n\n  fun nop() =\n\n    add(1, 2)  // Pointless, we ignore the result\n\n\n\n\nThe function parameters (if any) are specified in parentheses after the function name. Functions that don't take any parameters still need to have the parentheses.\n\n\nEach parameter is given a name and a type. In our example function \nadd\n has 2 parameters, \nx\n and \ny\n, both of which are type \nU32\n. The values passed to a function call (the \n1\n and \n2\n in our example) are called arguments and when the call is made they are evaluated and assigned to the parameters.

The value returned is simply the value of the function body (remember that everything is an expression), which is simply the value of the last command in the function.\n\n\nIf you want to exit a function early then use the \nreturn\n command.

To ensure this is done constructors must initialise all the fields in the object being constructed.\n\n\nCan I exit a constructor early?\n Yes. Just then use the \nreturn\n command without a value. The object must already be in a legal state to do this.\n\n\nCalling\n\n\nAs in many other languages, methods in Pony are called by providing the arguments within parentheses after the method name. The parentheses are required even if there are no arguments being passed to the method.\n\n\nclass Foo\n  fun hello(name: string): String =\n\n    \nhello \n + name\n\n  fun f() =\n\n    let a = hello(\nFred\n)\n\n\n\n\nConstructors are usually called \"on\" a type, by specifying the type that is to be created. To do this just specify the type, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the constructor you want to call.\n\n\nclass Foo\n  var _x: U32\n\n  new create() =\n\n    _x = 0\n\n  new from_int(x: U32) =\n\n    _x = x\n\nclass Bar\n  fun f() =\n\n    var a: Foo = Foo.create()\n    var b: Foo = Foo.from_int(3)\n\n\n\n\nFunctions are always called on an object. Again just specify the object, followed by a dot followed, by the name of the function to call. If the object to call on is omitted then the current object used (i.e. \nthis\n).\n\n\nclass Foo\n  var _x: U32\n\n  new create() =\n\n    _x = 0\n\n  new from_int(x: U32) =\n\n    _x = x\n\n  fun get(): U32 =\n\n    _x\n\nclass Bar\n  fun f() =\n\n    var a: Foo = Foo.from_int(3)\n    var b: U32 = a.get()\n    var c: U32 = g(b)\n\n  fun g(x: U32): U32 =\n\n    x + 1\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructors can also be called on an expression. Here an object is created of the same type as the specified expression, this is equivalent to directly specifying the type.\n\n\nclass Foo\n  var _x: U32\n\n  new create() =\n\n    _x = 0\n\n  new from_int(x: U32) =\n\n    _x = x\n\nclass Bar\n  fun f() =\n\n    var a: Foo = Foo.create()\n    var b: Foo = a.from_int(3)\n\n\n\n\nDefault arguments\n\n\nWhen defining a method you can provide default values for any of the arguments. The caller then has the choice to use the values you have provided or to provide their own. Default argument values are specified with a \n=\n after the parameter name.\n\n\nclass Coord\n  var _x: U32\n  var _y: U32\n\n  new create(x: U32 = 0, y: U32 = 0) =\n\n    _x = x\n    _y = y\n\nclass Bar\n  fun f() =\n\n    var a: Foo = Coord.create()     // Contains (0, 0)\n    var b: Foo = Coord.create(3)    // Contains (3, 0)\n    var b: Foo = Coord.create(3, 4) // Contains (3, 4)\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to provide default values for all of my arguments?\n No, you can provide defaults for as many, or as few, as you like.\n\n\nNamed arguments\n\n\nSo far, when calling methods we have always given all the arguments in order. This is known as using \npositional\n arguments. However, you can also specify the arguments in any order you like by specifying their names. This is known as using \nnamed\n arguments.\n\n\nTo call a method using named arguments use the \nwhere\n keyword, followed by the named arguments and their values.\n\n\nclass Coord\n  var _x: U32\n  var _y: U32\n\n  new create(x: U32 = 0, y: U32 = 0) =\n\n    _x = x\n    _y = y\n\nclass Bar\n  fun f() =\n\n    var a: Foo = Coord.create(where y = 4, x = 3)\n\n\n\n\nShould I specify \nwhere\n for each named argument?\n No. There must only be one \nwhere\n in each method call.\n\n\nNamed and positional arguments can be used together in a single call. Just start with the positional arguments you want to specify, then a \nwhere\n and finally the named arguments. But be careful, each argument must be specified only once.\n\n\nDefault arguments can also be used in combination with positional and named arguments, just miss out any for which you want to use the default.\n\n\nclass Foo\n  fun f(a:U32 = 1, b: U32 = 2, c: U32 = 3, d: U32 = 4, e: U32 = 5) =\n\n    0\n\n  fun g() =\n\n    f(6, 7 where d = 8)\n    // Equivalent to:\n    f(6, 7, 3, 8, 5)\n\n\n\n\nCan I call using positional arguments but miss out the first one?\n No. If you use positional arguments they must be the first ones in the call.\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nIn Pony method names start either with a lower case letter or with an underscore followed by a lower case letter. Methods with a leading underscore are private. This means they can only be called by code within the same package. Methods without a leading underscore are public and can be called by anyone.\n\n\nCan I start my method name with 2 (or more) underscores?\n No. If the first character is an underscore then the second one MUST be a lower case letter.",

Instead functions can raise errors that are handled by whatever code calls them.

This is checked at compile time, ensuring that an error cannot escape handling and crash the program.\n\n\nPartial constructors and behaviours\n\n\nConstructors may also be marked as partial. If a constructor raises an error then the construction is considered to have failed and the object under construction is discarded without ever being returned to the caller.\n\n\nWhen an actor constructor is called the actor is created and a reference to it is returned immediately. However the constructor code is executed asynchronously at some later time. If an actor constructor were to raise an error it would already be too late to report this to the caller. For this reason constructors for actors may not be partial.\n\n\nBehaviours are also executed asynchronously and so cannot be partial for the same reason.\n\n\nTry-then blocks\n\n\nIn addition to an \nelse\n error handler a try command can have a \nthen\n block. This is executed after the rest of the try, whether or not an error is raised or handled. Expanding our example from earlier:\n\n\ntry\n  callA()\n  if not callB() then error end\n  callC()\nelse\n  callD()\nthen\n  callE()\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe callE() will always be excuted.

If callB() returns false then the sequence executed is callA(), callB(), callD(), callE().\n\n\nDo I have to have an else error handler to have a then block?\n No. You can have a try-then block without an else if you like.\n\n\nWill my then block really always be executed, even if I return inside the try?\n Yes, your \nthen\n expression will \nalways\n be executed when the try block is complete. The only way it won't be is if the try never completes (due to an inifinite loop), the machine is powered off or the process is killed (and then, maybe).\n\n\nLanguage constructs that can raise errors\n\n\nThe only language construct that can raise an error, other than the error command or calling a partial method, is the \nas\n command. This converts the given value to the specified type, if it can be. If it can't then an error is raised. This means that the \nas\n command can only be used inside a try block or a partial method.\n\n\nComparison to exceptions in other languages\n\n\nPony exceptions behave very much the same as those in C++, Java, C#, Python and Ruby.

To get \nType.create()\n just use \nType\n.\n\n\nCombined create-apply\n\n\nIf a type has a create constructor that takes no arguments then the create and apply sugar can be used together. Just call on the type and calls to create and apply will be added. The call to create will take no arguments and the call to apply will take whatever arguments are supplied.\n\n\nvar foo = Foo()\nvar bar = Bar(x, 37 where crash = false)\n\n\n\n\nbecomes:\n\n\nvar foo = Foo.create().apply()\nvar bar = Bar.create().apply(x, 37 where crash = false)\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the create has default arguments? Does I get the combined create-apply sugar if I want to use the defaults?\n The combined create-apply sugar can only be used when the create constructor has no arguments. If there are default arguments then this sugar cannot be used.\n\n\nUpdate\n\n\nThe \nupdate\n sugar allows any class to use an assignment to accept data. Many languages allow this for assigning into collections, for example a simple C array, \na[3] = x;\n.\n\n\nIn any assignment where the left hand side is a function call, Pony will translate this to a call to update, with the value from the right hand side as an extra argument.

Any object can allow this syntax simply by providing an appropriate function \nupdate\n with an argument \nvalue\n.\n\n\nDoes my update function have to have a single parameter that takes an integer?\n No, you can define update to take whatever parameters you like, as long as there is one called \nvalue\n. The following are all fine:\n\n\nfoo1(2, 3) = x\nfoo2() = x\nfoo3(37, \nHello\n, 3.5 where a = 2, b = 3) = x\n\n\n\n\nDoes it matter where \nvalue\n appears in my parameter list?\n Whilst it doesn't strictly matter it is good practice to put \nvalue\n as the last parameter.

            "text": "Pony code is organised into \npackages\n. Each program and library is a single package, possibly using other packages.\n\n\nThe package structure\n\n\nThe package is the basic unit of code in Pony. It corresponds directly to a directory in the file system, all Pony source files within that directory are within that package. Note that this does not include files in any sub-directories.\n\n\nEvery source file is within exactly one package. Hence all Pony code is in packages.\n\n\nA package is usually split into several source files, although it does not have to be. This is purely a convenience to allow better code organisation and the compiler treats all the code within a package as if it were from a single file.\n\n\nThe package is the privacy boundary for types and methods. That is:\n\n\n\n\nPrivate types (those whose name starts with an underscore) can be used only within the package in which they are defined.\n\n\nPrivate methods (those whose name starts with an underscore) can be called only from code within the package in which they are defined.\n\n\n\n\nIt follows that all code within a package is assumed to know of, and trust, all the rest of the code in the package.\n\n\nThere is no such concept as a sub-package in Pony. For example the packages \"foo/bar\" and \"foo/bar/wombat\" will, presumably, perform related tasks but they are two independent packages. Package \"foo/bar\" does not contain package \"foo/bar/wombat\" and neither has access to the private elements of the other.\n\n\nUse command\n\n\nTo use a package in your code you need to have a \nuse\n command. This tells the compiler to find the package you need and make the types defined in it available to you. Every Pony file that needs to know about a type from a package must have a use command for it.\n\n\nUse commands are a similar concept to Python and Java \"import\", C/C++ \"#include\" and C# \"using\" commands, but not exactly the same. They come at the beginning of Pony files and look like this:\n\n\nuse \ncollections\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will find all of the publicly visible types defined in the \ncollections\n package and add them to the type namespace of the file containing the use command. These types are then available to use within that file, just as if they were defined locally.\n\n\nFor example, the standard library contains the package \ntime\n. This contains the following definition (among others):\n\n\nprimitive Time\n  fun now(): (I64, I64)\n\n\n\n\nTo access the \nnow\n function just add a use command:\n\n\nuse \ntime\n\n\nclass Foo\n  fun f() =\n\n    (var secs, var nsecs) = Time.now()\n\n\n\n\nUse names\n\n\nAs we saw above the use command adds all the public types from a package into the namespace of the using file. This means that using a package may define type names that you want to use for your own types. Furthermore, if you use two packages within a file they may both define the same type name, causing a clash in your namespace. For example:\n\n\n// In package A\nclass Foo\n\n// In package B\nclass Foo\n\n// In your code\nuse \npackageA\n\nuse \npackageB\n\n\nclass Bar\n  var _x: Foo\n\n\n\n\nThe declarations of _x is an error because we don't know which \nFoo\n is being referred to. Actually using 'Foo' is not even required, simply using both package A and package B is enough to cause an error here.\n\n\nTo avoid this problem the use command allows you to specify an alias. If you do this then only that alias is put into your namespace. The types from the used package can then be accessed using this alias as a qualifier. Our example now becomes:\n\n\n// In package A\nclass Foo\n\n// In package B\nclass Foo\n\n// In your code\nuse a = \npackageA\n\nuse b = \npackageB\n\n\nclass Bar\n  var _x: a.Foo  // The Foo from package A\n  var _y: b.Foo  // The Foo from package B\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer you can give an alias to only one of the packages. \nFoo\n will then still be added to your namespace referring to the unaliased package:\n\n\n// In package A\nclass Foo\n\n// In package B\nclass Foo\n\n// In your code\nuse \npackageA\n\nuse b = \npackageB\n\n\nclass Bar\n  var _x: Foo  // The Foo from package A\n  var _y: b.Foo  // The Foo from package B\n\n\n\n\nCan I just specify the full package path and forget about the use command, like I do in Java and C#?\n No, you can't do that in Pony. You can't refer to one package based on a use command for another package and you can't use types from a package without a use command for that package. Every package that you want to use must have its own use command.\n\n\nAre there limits on the names I can use for an alias?\n Use alias names have to start with a lower case letter. Other than that you can use whatever name you want, as long as you're not using that name for any other purpose in your file.\n\n\nUse conditions\n\n\nSometimes you may want a use command that only works under certain circumstances, most commonly only on a particular OS or only for debug builds. You can do this by specifying a condition for a use comamnd:\n\n\nuse \nfoo\n if linux\nuse \nbar\n if (windows and debug)\n\n\n\n\nUse conditions can use any of the methods defined in \nbuiltin/Platform\n as conditions. They can also use the operators \nand\n, \nor\n, \nxor\n and \nnot\n. As with other expressions in Pony, parentheses \nmust\n be used to indicate precedence if more than one of \nand\n, \nor\n and \nxor\n is used.\n\n\nAny use command whose condition evaluates to false is simply ignored.\n\n\nScheme indicators\n\n\nThe string we give to a use command is known as the \nspecifier\n. This consists of a \nscheme\n indicator and a \nlocator\n, separated by a colon. The scheme indicator tells the use command what we want it to do, for example the scheme indicator for including a package is \"package\". If no colon is found within the specifier string then the use command assumes you meant \"package\".\n\n\nThe following two use commands are exactly equivalent:\n\n\nuse \nfoo\n\nuse \npackage:foo\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a locator string that includes a colon, for example an absolute path in Windows, then you \nhave\n to include the \"package\" scheme specifier:\n\n\nuse \nC:/foo/bar\n  // Error, scheme \nC\n is unknown\nuse \npackage:C:/foo/bar\n  // OK\n\n\n\n\nTo allow use commands to be portable across operating systems, and to avoid confusion with escape characters, '/' should always be used as the path separator in use commands, even on Windows.\n\n\nStandard library\n\n\nThe Pony standard library is a collection of packages that can each be used as needed to provide a variety of functionality. For example the \nfiles\n package provides file access and the \ncollections\n package provides generic lists, maps, sets and so on.\n\n\nThere is also a special package in the standard library called \nbuiltin\n. This contains various types that the compiler has to treat specially and are so common that all Pony code needs to know about them. All Pony source files have an implicit \nuse \"builtin\"\n command. This means all the types defined in the package builtin are automatically available in the type namespace of all Pony source files.",

Note that this does not include files in any sub-directories.  Every source file is within exactly one package. Hence all Pony code is in packages.  A package is usually split into several source files, although it does not have to be. This is purely a convenience to allow better code organisation and the compiler treats all the code within a package as if it were from a single file.  The package is the privacy boundary for types and methods. That is:   Private types (those whose name starts with an underscore) can be used only within the package in which they are defined.  Private methods (those whose name starts with an underscore) can be called only from code within the package in which they are defined.   It follows that all code within a package is assumed to know of, and trust, all the rest of the code in the package.  There is no such concept as a sub-package in Pony. For example the packages \"foo/bar\" and \"foo/bar/wombat\" will, presumably, perform related tasks but they are two independent packages. Package \"foo/bar\" does not contain package \"foo/bar/wombat\" and neither has access to the private elements of the other.",

Use commands are a similar concept to Python and Java \"import\", C/C++ \"#include\" and C# \"using\" commands, but not exactly the same. They come at the beginning of Pony files and look like this:  use  collections   This will find all of the publicly visible types defined in the  collections  package and add them to the type namespace of the file containing the use command. These types are then available to use within that file, just as if they were defined locally.  For example, the standard library contains the package  time . This contains the following definition (among others):  primitive Time\n  fun now(): (I64, I64)  To access the  now  function just add a use command:  use  time \n\nclass Foo\n  fun f() = \n    (var secs, var nsecs) = Time.now()",

This means that using a package may define type names that you want to use for your own types. Furthermore, if you use two packages within a file they may both define the same type name, causing a clash in your namespace. For example:  // In package A\nclass Foo\n\n// In package B\nclass Foo\n\n// In your code\nuse  packageA \nuse  packageB \n\nclass Bar\n  var _x: Foo  The declarations of _x is an error because we don't know which  Foo  is being referred to. Actually using 'Foo' is not even required, simply using both package A and package B is enough to cause an error here.  To avoid this problem the use command allows you to specify an alias. If you do this then only that alias is put into your namespace. The types from the used package can then be accessed using this alias as a qualifier. Our example now becomes:  // In package A\nclass Foo\n\n// In package B\nclass Foo\n\n// In your code\nuse a =  packageA \nuse b =  packageB \n\nclass Bar\n  var _x: a.Foo  // The Foo from package A\n  var _y: b.Foo  // The Foo from package B  If you prefer you can give an alias to only one of the packages.  Foo  will then still be added to your namespace referring to the unaliased package:  // In package A\nclass Foo\n\n// In package B\nclass Foo\n\n// In your code\nuse  packageA \nuse b =  packageB \n\nclass Bar\n  var _x: Foo  // The Foo from package A\n  var _y: b.Foo  // The Foo from package B  Can I just specify the full package path and forget about the use command, like I do in Java and C#?  No, you can't do that in Pony. You can't refer to one package based on a use command for another package and you can't use types from a package without a use command for that package. Every package that you want to use must have its own use command.  Are there limits on the names I can use for an alias?  Use alias names have to start with a lower case letter.

The FFI library provides a stable\nand portable API and high level programming interface allowing Pony\nto integrate with native libraries easily.\n\n\nNote that calling C (or other low level languages) is inherently dangerous. C code fundamentally has access to all memory in the process and can change any of it, either deliberately or due to bugs. This is one of the language's most useful, but also most dangerous, features. Calling well written, bug free, C code will have no ill effects on your program. However, calling buggy or malicious C code or calling C incorrectly can cause your Pony program to go wrong, including corrupting data and crashing. Consequently all of Pony guarantees regarding not crashing, memory safety and concurrent correctness can be voided by calling FFI functions.\n\n\nCalling FFI functions\n\n\nFFI is built into Pony and native libraries may be directly referenced\nin Pony code. There is no need to code or configure bindings, wrappers or interfaces.\n\n\nHere's an example of an FFI call in Pony from the standard library. It looks like a normal method call, with just a few differences:\n\n\n@fwrite[U64](data.cstring(), U64(1), data.size(), _handle)\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference is the @ symbol before the function name. This is what tells us it's an FFI call. Any time you see an @ in Pony there's an FFI going on.\n\n\nThe other key difference is that the return type of the function is specified after the function name, in square brackets. This is because the compiler needs to know what type the value returned is (if any), but has no way to determine that, so it needs you to explicitly tell it.\n\n\nThere are a few unusual things going on with the arguments to this FFI call as well. For the second argument, for which we're passing the value 1, we've had to specify that this is a U64. Again this is because the compiler needs to know what size argument to use, but has no way to determine this.\n\n\nSafely does it\n\n\nIt is VERY important that when calling FFI functions you MUST get the parameter and return types right\n. The compiler has no way to know what the native code expects and will just believe whatever you do. Errors here can cause invalid data to be passed to the FFI function or returned to Pony, which can lead to program crashes.\n\n\nTo help avoid bugs here Pony allows you to specify the type signatures of FFI functions in advance. Whilst you must still get the types correct the arguments you provide at each FFI call site are checked against the declared signature. This means that you must get a type wrong, in the same way, in at least 2 places for a bug to exist. This won't help if the argument types the native code expects are different to what you think they are, but it will protect you against trivial mistakes and simple typos.\n\n\nFFI signatures are declared using the \nuse\n command. Here's an example from the standard library:\n\n\nuse @SSL_CTX_ctrl[I32](ctx: Pointer[_SSLContext] tag, op: I32, arg: I32,\n  parg: Pointer[U8] tag) if windows\n\nuse @SSL_CTX_ctrl[I64](ctx: Pointer[_SSLContext] tag, op: I32, arg: I64,\n  parg: Pointer[U8] tag) if not windows\n\nclass SSLContext val\n  new create() =\n\n    // set SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2\n    @SSL_CTX_ctrl(_ctx, 32, 0x01000000, Pointer[U8])\n\n\n\n\nThe @ symbol tells us that the use command is an FFI signature declaration. The types specified here are considered authoritative and any FFI calls that differ are considered to be an error.\n\n\nNote that we no longer need to specify the return type at the call site, since the signature declaration has already told us what it is. However, it is perfectly acceptable to specify it again if you want to.\n\n\nThe use @ command can take a condition just like other use commands. This is useful in this case, where the Windows version of SSL_CTX_ctrl has a slightly different signature to other platforms.\n\n\nC types\n\n\nMany C functions require types that don't have an exact equivalent in Pony. A variety of features are provided for these.\n\n\nFor FFI functions that have no return value (ie they return \nvoid\n in C) the return value specified should be \n[None]\n.\n\n\nIn Pony String is an object with a header and fields, but in C a char* is simply a pointer to character data. The .cstring() function on String provides us with a valid pointer to hand to C. Our fwrite example above makes use of this for the first argument.\n\n\nPony classes corresponds directly to pointers to the class in C.\n\n\nFor C pointers to simple types, such as U64, the Pony \nPointer[]\n polymorphic type should be used, with a \ntag\n capability. \nPointer[U8] tag\n should be used for void*. This can be seen in our SSL_CTX_ctrl example above.\n\n\nTo pass pointers to values to C an ampersand (\n) can be used, just like taking an address in C. This is done in the standard library to pass the address of a U64 to an FFI functions that takes a uint64_t* as an out parameter:\n\n\nvar len = U64(0)\n@pcre2_substring_length_bynumber_8[I32](_match, i.u32(), \nlen)\n\n\n\n\nFFI functions raising errors\n\n\nFFI functions can raise Pony errors. Functions in existing C libraries are very unlikely to do this, but support libraries specifically written for use with Pony may well do.\n\n\nFFI calls to functions that \nmight\n raise an error \nmust\n mark it as such by adding a ? after the arguments.

The FFI call site then does not have to mark it as well, although doing so is allowed.\n\n\nuse @os_send[U64](ev: Event, buf: Pointer[U8] tag, len: U64) ?\n\n@os_send(_event, data.cstring(), data.size()) // May raise an error",
